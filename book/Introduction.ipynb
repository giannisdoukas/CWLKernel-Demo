    "CWL has roots in “make” and many similar tools that determine order of execution based on dependencies between tasks. However unlike “make”, CWL tasks are isolated and you must be explicit about your inputs and outputs. The benefit of explicitness and isolation are flexibility, portability, and scalability: tools and workflows described with CWL can transparently leverage technologies such as Docker and be used with CWL implementations from different vendors. CWL is well suited for describing large-scale workflows in cluster, cloud and high performance computing environments where tasks are scheduled in parallel across many nodes."
