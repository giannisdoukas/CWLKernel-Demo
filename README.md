# CWL Tutorial in Jupyter Notebook

This is a demo on how to use [CWLKernel](https://github.com/giannisdoukas/CWLJNIKernel/)  
to execute [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) from [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

With CWLKernel you can document, compose & execute CWL workflows. 
In the presented demo I illustrate how you can use the kernel for educational purposes.
For that reason used the [user guide](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/)
provided by the CWL and I added some extra information which are CWLKernel specific.

> For the tutorial the use of Jupyter Lab is suggested.
